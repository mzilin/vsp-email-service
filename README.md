## Introduction

The **Email Service** is a core component of the **Video Streaming Platform**. It manages the sending of transactional emails (such as account confirmations, password resets, and notifications) as well as marketing communications. It integrates with Amazon SES to ensure reliable and scalable email delivery. Key responsibilities include:

- **Transactional Emails**: Sends critical user emails like account activation, password resets and important notifications.
- **Marketing Emails**: Delivers promotional and engagement-focused content to users, supporting marketing campaigns and retention efforts.
- **Template Management**: Utilises Thymeleaf to generate dynamic, personalised email templates.

By centralising email management, the **Email Service** ensures consistent communication across the platform, supporting both operational and marketing needs.


## Technology Stack

This service is built using a modern, cloud-native Java stack, optimised for reactive, scalable microservices:

- **Java** `21`: LTS version with enhanced performance and modern language features.
- **Spring Boot** `4.1.0`: Rapid development framework for standalone, production-ready Java apps.
- **Spring Cloud** `2025.1.2`: Provides essential microservice components like config management, service discovery and API routing.
- **Gradle** `9.5.1`: Powerful build tool with fast incremental builds and powerful dependency management.
- **Docker**: Containerises apps for consistent, portable development and deployment.

## Message Queues

The service does not expose public REST endpoints. Instead, it consumes messages asynchronously via **RabbitMQ** using a Direct Exchange.

### Consumed Queue

| Queue                   | Routing Key              | Exchange        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| `RMQ_PLATFORM_EMAILS_Q` | `RMQ_PLATFORM_EMAILS_RK` | `RMQ_EXCHANGE`  |

The consumer reads an `EmailRequest` payload and routes it to the appropriate handler based on the `type` field:

| Message Type | Additional Fields | Description                                              |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `verify`     | `passcode`        | Sends an account verification passcode to the user.      |
| `welcome`    | —                 | Sends a welcome email after successful account creation. |
| `reset`      | `resetToken`      | Sends a password reset link to the user.                 |


## Email Templates

Emails are rendered using **Thymeleaf** templates. All templates extend a shared `base.html` layout that provides consistent Streamix branding, header, and footer.

| Template             | Triggered By  | Description                                                                |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `verifyAccount.html` | `verify`      | Account verification passcode email. Passcode is valid for 15 minutes.     |
| `welcome.html`       | `welcome`     | Welcome email sent after registration, highlighting key platform features. |
| `resetPassword.html` | `reset`       | Password reset link email. Link is valid for 15 minutes.                   |


## Testing

This project uses a combination of **unit tests** and **integration tests** to ensure reliability, correctness and maintainability.

To execute all tests, run:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

This setup ensures that changes can be safely verified and that the codebase remains robust, maintainable and well-documented.


## CI/CD & Deployment

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the build, test and deployment processes, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.

- The **Build** workflow runs on every push and pull request to the `main` and `prod` branches. This step verifies that all commits compile successfully and pass unit tests before they are merged, maintaining code quality.
- The **Codecov** workflow runs on pushes to the main branch, where it executes tests, generates a Jacoco coverage report and uploads the results to Codecov.
- Finally, a **Deploy** workflow is triggered when a pull request is merged into the `prod` branch. It builds a Docker image of the microservice, pushes it to the **AWS ECR** container registry and deploys it to the **AWS ECS** environment.

Branch protections and **GitHub Secrets** are used to manage credentials and safeguard the CI/CD pipelines.
